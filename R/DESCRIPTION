Title: Estimation of Bootstrapped Confidence Intervals of the Asymptotic Mean Squared Error for Regression Disconinuity Designs.

Description: This package estimates bootstrapped confidence intervals around the asymptotic
        mean squared error (AMSE) of different polynomial orders in a regression
        discontinuity design. These compare the fit of different polynomial
        orders and can be used to choose between them if the estimate is
        senstive to the polynomial order choice.
